			It is approximately 1.5 miles but can take up to 1 hour because of all the points of interest to view en route.</p>
			<p>It is on hard surfaces and, although there are some steps, these can be avoided and so is wheelchair friendly 
			although there are cobbles and some slopes.</p>

            <p>Titus Salt (1803-1876) came to Bradford in 1822, when his father moved there, and started a wool merchant 
			business, where he worked from 1825.  In 1829, he began his own worsted stuff manufacturing business.</p>
			<p>By 1850, he was probably the richest man in Bradford and it is then that he formed the idea of building 
			Saltaire (built between 1851-1871).</p>
			<p>This was to be a huge mill with accommodation, and facilities for recreation, 
			hospital and schools for all the workers. It is laid out in a grid pattern and with no public houses, pawnshop nor police.</p>
			<p>It was heralded as a great success and Titus was made a Baronet in 1869 and Emperor Napoleon III even made 
			him a member of the Legion of Honour.</p>

			mill at the end of the road.</p>
			<p>You can also visit by train as there is a station on the opposite side of the road to the mill.</p>
			<p>This is a circular walk and upon our return to the mill you are encouraged to go in and look at the Hockney exhibition, 
			the shops and other facilities within (it is free to enter).  Please be patient and wait until your return.</p>

            <p>START:  The walk starts at Salts Mill, where there is a very large free car park as shown here 
			(but it is only open between 10.00am and 5.30pm weekdays and 10.00am and 6.00pm weekends).</p>
			<p>This is the first car park you meet on the right before passing any buildings, but if it is a weekend 
			keep going right to the mill itself as the normally-reserved parking there is free to use.</p>
			<p>If you have a disabled badge then also keep going right to the mill itself as there are a number of disabled 
			bays just outside the mill door. </p>
			<p>Walk past the side entrance to the mill.  
			Note the two very tall towers which flank the tunnel entrance; they were intentionally designed to mimic 
			those of Osborne House, the residence of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, on the Isle of Wight 
			(Salt was an admirer of Prince Albert).</p>
			<p>The mill, opened in 1853, made cloth from alpaca wool and mohair from the Angora goat. 
			Titus came across some alpaca wool in 1836 in a Liverpool warehouse, which he bought and perfected into 
			cloth in an earlier mill in Bradford.  It was upon this that the mill and village of Saltaire were founded.</p>

			<p>You arrive at the road that slopes from left to right (Victoria Road).  
			On the opposite side of the road, you will see the building shown here.</p>
			<p>This is the main mill Dining Hall (for the workers), who would have entered via the tunnel rather than 
			by crossing the road. This accommodated up to 800 people and about 600 workers took breakfast and about 
			700 took dinner daily. </p>
			<p>Within the circle above the door is the Salt crest (the bird is an ostrich with a horseshoe 
			in its beak - the ostrich represents willing obedience and serenity and the horseshoe is for good luck and protection).  
			At the time of building, Salt was not entitled to a coat of arms - he just invented one for himself.</p>
			<p>Salt did not run the Dining Hall, but charged his workers 5% per annum (&pound;180) on 
			the &pound;3600 it cost him to build it.</p>

            <p>Opposite to the mill entrance, you will see the Congregational Church (now the United Reformed Church), 
			which we will visit now.</p>
			<p>Before the church was built, the congregation met at 10 Caroline Street (1854) and then in the Dining Hall (1856).  
			Opened on 13th April 1859, it was the first public building erected in Saltaire and seats 600.</p>
			<p>It is richly decorated with coloured marble in the Italian style.  
			Heavy draperies had to be introduced into the church to solve a problem with the acoustics.</p>
			<p>To the left as you approach it, on the outside, is the Mausoleum, where Titus himself is buried along with 
			some members of his family.</p>
			<p>The Salt family occupied the 3rd pew from the front on the left.  
			There is also a balcony built at the insistence of Salt's wife, Caroline, for the family, but Salt 
			preferred to sit amongst his workers.  The story goes that Salt bought two massive chandeliers and had them 
			hung so that they obscured the view from that balcony, as a joke on his wife.</p>
			<p>Note the initials TS above every window (you will see this again and again on most buildings).</p>

			<p>The Office House was occupied by a butler, cook-housekeeper and a general servant to cater for the Salt family, 
			when in the village.</p>
			<p>The stables were for horses for the domestic use of the family 
			only - not connected with work in the mill.</p>

			The chimney is a copy of the campanile of the Venetian church of Santa Maria Gloriosa.</p>
			<p>It was so designed, so as not to spoil the view from Victoria Road. Unfortunately, its Bell Tower had to 
			be replaced in 1937 by the current cowl as it became unsafe.</p>

            <p>Roberts Park opened, with a great ceremony, one evening in 1871 as 'Saltaire Park'.  
			All the employees attended (the mill was closed early) and there were speeches and bands.</p>
			<p>The park was for the use of the villagers, but with many rules - No music, singing, preaching, lecture or 
			public discussion etc, no stone throwing, disorderly conduct, bad language, gambling, begging, alcohol, 
			smoking (in the alcoves) or spitting - and the playgrounds not to be used on Sundays.</p>
			<p>This is the plaque on the gatehouse.
			Sir James Roberts changed the name to Roberts Park when he became owner of Saltaire in 1893.  
			In January 1920 he gave the park to Bradford as a memorial to his late son Bertram.</p>

			<p>The houses were designed for different grades of his workforce - note the difference in size of houses as you

			<p>Salt's senior staff were reluctant to live in Saltaire (as was Salt himself) despite the superior 
			accommodation and, in 1871, some of the houses in Albert Road were rented to people not connected to the mill.  
			None of the houses were 'back-to-back' which was a common style elsewhere.</p>
			<p>Today all the houses are privately owned.</p>
